{{OVERVIEW}}

Minimum severity to report: {{MIN_SEVERITY}}

Analyze this diff chunk. Only report issues where added lines include [Line N] markers.

CRITICAL ANALYSIS AREAS:
🔴 SECURITY: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, authentication/authorization flaws, input validation, data exposure, cryptography
🔴 BUGS & LOGIC: Null dereferences, array bounds, race conditions, deadlocks, infinite loops, incorrect algorithms, edge cases
🔴 PERFORMANCE: Memory leaks, inefficient queries, quadratic or worse algorithms, redundant computation, resource exhaustion
🔴 RELIABILITY: Error handling gaps, exception swallowing, transactional integrity, data consistency, retries/backoff
🔴 MAINTAINABILITY: Excessive complexity, duplication, tight coupling, missing docs, obscure naming
🔴 TESTING: Missing coverage, weak assertions, brittle fixtures, missing mocks/stubs

SEVERITY GUIDELINES:
- CRITICAL: Security vulnerabilities, data corruption, crashes, production outages
- HIGH: Logic flaws, major performance regressions, reliability risks, significant bugs
- MEDIUM: Maintainability problems, moderate performance issues, code-quality gaps
- LOW: Style inconsistencies, documentation gaps, minor optimisations

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Hunt for subtle bugs that can trigger runtime failures in NEW code.
2. Flag any security vulnerabilities introduced on ADDED lines.
3. Evaluate performance impact of the NEW changes (algorithmic or resource usage).
4. Skip reporting if confidence is low or evidence is missing.
5. Never infer line numbers—only use explicit [Line N] tags.
6. The `problematicCode` object MUST contain the exact added diff lines (including [Line N] markers) that demonstrate the issue.
7. If no specific lines apply, set `problematicCode.snippet` to an empty string.
